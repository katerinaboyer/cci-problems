Cracking the Coding Interview Book Solutions

The purpose of this repo is to provide reference material for myself as I work through the Cracking the Coding Interview book by Gayle Laakman McDowell. I will be writing solutions in python as practice in a language I have minimal experience with. Additionally, I will be using the unittest module for practice in TDD (although outside of an Agile environment)
